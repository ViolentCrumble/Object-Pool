This is a basic Object Pool for Unity.

Drag in 1 of each object you want to be in the pool.
Then call GetPooledObject when you need one.

if it doesn't have one availible, it will spawn 1 new one and place it in the pool.

This will change your spawn rate each time, however i have no found it to be an issue.

Later i will upload some variants for different needs, such as theme, or weighting based on odds.
